# Advent of Code 2024 - TS & JS solutions

My TS/ JS solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

### How to use

To run the JS solutions, simply go to `https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/X/input`, open the console of your developer tools, then run the script.

To run the TS solutions, you need to first copy and paste the input manually to `inputs/d6.txt`, then run `deno src/d6.ts`.

### Files structure

The repository is structured as follows:

-   `inputs` a folder to store all the inputs required for TS solutions
    -   `dX.txt` the input for day X.
-   `src` a folder to store all my solutions
    -   `dX.js` the JS solution for day X.
    -   `dX.ts` the TS solution for day X.
